## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session called **CA162 - Practical security and compliance tactics for SAP Business Suite**.  

## Overview

In this workshop, we will take a look at the security relevant APIs and integrate them into SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) for a simple security use case: _How many of our communication arrangements in our SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition instance have never been used?_
By the end of the session, youâ€™ll know how to extract, visualize, and analyze key security data using SAP tools.

## Requirements

To follow the exercises in this repository, you need access to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition system with administrative rights, as well as access to an SAC tenant.
